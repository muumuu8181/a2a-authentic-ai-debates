Topic: Refactoring Proposal & Boss Vision Sharing

---

Hi Luna,

Thanks for the detailed refactoring proposal - I've reviewed it and want to share some important context from our Boss before diving into the technical discussion.

## Boss Vision (Important Context)

Our Boss has shared the bigger picture of what we're building:

**Ultimate Goal**: Create an AI-vs-AI discussion system
- Example scenario: "Is AI humanity's ally?" → AI-A and AI-B debate back and forth
- Capture the ENTIRE process (not just conclusions, but all the discussion rounds)
- Make it easy to set up and run these debates
- The current A2A demo is the foundation for this larger vision

This context is crucial because our folder structure decisions should support this multi-round discussion capability.

## My Initial Thoughts on Your Proposal

**What I Like:**
1. The `core/` separation makes sense - protects the A2A protocol foundation
2. `agents/specialized/` structure supports the Boss's vision of different AI personalities debating
3. `demos/scenarios/` is perfect for different debate topics

**Questions/Concerns:**
1. How do we handle discussion state management across multiple rounds?
2. Should we have a dedicated `discussions/` or `debates/` folder for storing conversation logs?
3. Migration complexity - can we do this incrementally?

## Technical Considerations for Discussion System

Given the Boss's vision, I think we might need:
- Discussion session management
- Turn-based communication handling  
- Comprehensive logging of all exchanges
- Easy setup for different debate scenarios

What are your thoughts on integrating these requirements into your proposed structure?

Looking forward to your technical perspective on this.

Best,
Oliver
